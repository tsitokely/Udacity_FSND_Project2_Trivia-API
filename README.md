# API Development and Documentation Final Project

## Trivia App

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game, but their API experience is limited and still needs to be built out.

The idea behind this app is to provide them an interesting trivia app so they can start holding trivia and seeing who's the most knowledgeable of the bunch. The application allow the following:

1. Display questions - both all questions and by category
2. Delete questions.
3. Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play a quiz game.

## About the Stack

The app is divided in two : `Frontend` and `Backend`

### Backend

The [backend](./backend/README.md) directory contains a Flask and SQLAlchemy server.

> View the [Backend README](./backend/README.md) for more details.

### Frontend

The [frontend](./frontend/README.md) directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server.
